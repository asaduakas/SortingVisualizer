## Introduction
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Visualizer! This project was created as a fun and educational exercise to refresh and demonstrate fundamental concepts in algorithm design and implementation. The visualizer provides an interactive way to see how different sorting algorithms work and how they compare in terms of efficiency and performance.

## Features
- Interactive UI to select different sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed for tailored visualization.
- Supported algorithms: Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort.
- Responsive design for a wide range of devices.

- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Visit the visualizer at [Link to your project if hosted online].
2. Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the slider.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Click on "Generate Random Array" to display a new set of data.
5. Hit the "Sort" button to visualize the sorting process.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more sorting algorithms for a comprehensive understanding.
- Implementing a comparison feature to contrast different algorithms side by side.
